    <h3>Algorithm</h3>
    <blockquote>The algorithm is more convenient to describe if we assume that the input graph is already split into two parts (although, in fact, the algorithm can be implemented in such a way that the input graph is not explicitly split into two parts).

        The algorithm looks at all the vertices v of the first part of the graph: v=1â€¦n1. If the current vertex v is already saturated with the current matching (i.e., some edge adjacent to it has already been selected), then skip this vertex. Otherwise, the algorithm tries to saturate this vertex, for which it starts a search for an augmenting path starting from this vertex.</blockquote>
